# Brain Tumor Classification App
This project addresses the critical challenge of detecting brain tumors using machine learning, achieving high accuracy through transfer learning. The app leverages the EfficientNetB0 pre-trained model to classify MRI images, providing a valuable tool for medical diagnosis.

# Project Overview
The Brain Tumor Classification app was developed to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans. Using a pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model, the app accurately categorizes images into one of four classes:
1. No Tumor
2. Meningioma Tumor
3. Glioma Tumor
4. Pituitary Tumor
This app is designed to streamline tumor detection, offering a robust solution with a user-friendly interface.

# Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Once the installation is complete, launch the app by running the following command:

streamlit run main.py

# Conclusion
This project serves as a comprehensive tool for brain tumor classification, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to assist in medical diagnosis. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
